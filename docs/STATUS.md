# Status

Last updated: 2026-08-09

## Current milestone

**Milestones 0–4 complete.** Seedream and Seedance 2.5 are both verified
against the live BytePlus Ark API, and the panel docks inside After Effects.

## The V1 loop works

```
AE frame → Capture → Asset Library → Seedream (image) or Seedance 2.5 (video)
        → result registered → lineage → reopen recipe → variation
        → import / insert at playhead
```

Verified end to end on real generations, driven through the panel's own client:

- **Seedream** `seedream-4-0-250828` — image-to-image from a captured frame.
  Results visibly retain the frame's structure and diverge by seed, so the
  recorded lineage reflects a real derivation.
- **Seedance 2.5** `dreamina-seedance-2-5-260628` — image-to-video from a
  captured frame. 4s at 480p, about 4 minutes, a complete 2.3MB mp4 whose box
  chain ends exactly at EOF, registered with lineage back to the source frame
  and a recoverable recipe.

Also verified in a workspace path containing spaces, and with the AK/SK signer
against the asset library.

`npm test` — 148 tests. `npm run typecheck` — clean.

**Verified live against the BytePlus Ark API (2026-08-09).** The whole loop
runs on real Seedream: capture -> generate -> register -> lineage -> reopen
recipe -> variation -> import at playhead. Also verified: the AK/SK signer
authenticates the asset library, and content-hash dedupe finds existing
registrations by fuzzy name search.

Two bugs only a live run could have surfaced, both fixed and covered by
regression tests:

1. **A synchronous provider marked its job succeeded before the outputs
   existed.** Seedream answers inline, so the job flipped terminal while the
   result was still downloading — anything polling for completion saw a
   finished job with zero outputs. Terminal status now belongs solely to the
   step that registers the media.
2. **Ark returns JPEG and says nothing about it.** The adapter claimed
   `image/png`, so files were written as `.png` containing JPEG, with wrong
   mime metadata and silently skipped thumbnails. The ingestor now sniffs the
   bytes and treats any provider-declared type as a hint.

## What exists

### Packages

- `@seed-ae/domain` — Zod schemas for Asset, AeContext, Generation, Job, the
  HTTP wire contracts, normalized `SeedError` codes, prefixed ids.
- `@seed-ae/media` — dependency-free PNG encoder **and** decoder, box-average
  resize. Powers mock rendering and thumbnails without native modules.
- `@seed-ae/storage` — `node:sqlite`, migrations (v2), repositories for assets,
  generations and jobs, lineage walk, workspace layout, storage-URI validation.
  Append-only and immutability enforced by triggers.
- `@seed-ae/providers` — `GenerationProvider` + capabilities, `ProviderRegistry`,
  `MockImageProvider`, `MockVideoProvider`, `SeedreamProvider`,
  `SeedanceProvider` (working), and the Ark layer: request signer, OpenAPI
  client, asset library with content-hash dedupe, per-model constraints.
- `@seed-ae/ae-host` — `AeHostAdapter` contract and `MockAeHostAdapter`.

### Service (`apps/service`)

Loopback HTTP, bearer auth, CORS for local origins, correlation ids, redacting
logger. Routes: health, AE context/capture/import, asset register/list/get/file
(+thumbnail variant)/lineage/recipe, providers, generations, jobs (+cancel).
Generation runs as a background job; the request never blocks on a provider.

### Panel (`apps/panel`) and extension (`apps/extension`)

React + Vite, styled as Windows 95 (see ADR 0006). Generate / Library /
Lineage views, asset detail with recipe, provenance, raw payload, and Import /
Insert at playhead / Variation / Use as reference actions. Controls are driven
by declared provider capabilities.

Ships as a CEP extension that docks in After Effects **and Premiere Pro**:
`npm run install:extension`, then Window → Extensions → SEED / AE.
In CEP the panel drives AE itself through `jsx/seed-host.jsx` (capture via
`saveFrameToPng`, import into a SEED folder, insert at playhead inside an undo
group) and registers results with the service. In a browser it falls back to
the service's mock host, so everything stays testable without Adobe.

## Known gaps

- **Video posters are borrowed, not extracted.** There is no video decoder
  here, so a generated clip shows the thumbnail of the frame it was generated
  from. For image-to-video that frame *is* the first frame, so it is honest —
  but it is not a real extract, and a text-to-video result gets no poster.
- **No public URL publisher**, so Ark asset registration (`asset://`) cannot be
  used for local frames; references go inline as data URLs. That is the wrong
  route for recognisable real people — see ADR 0005.
- **Region of Interest silently halves a capture.** Detected and warned about
  now, but not prevented: AE has no scripting API to read or clear it.
- Thumbnails cover PNG and JPEG. WebP has no decoder and degrades to none.
- Interrupted jobs are closed out as failed on startup rather than resumed.
- Seedance text-to-video is implemented but only image-to-video has been run
  live; accepted parameter values may differ between the two modes.

## Direction agent (Milestone 5, first slice)

`POST /v1/agent/compose` turns a described shot into a proposed generation:
Claude reads the description and the actual reference thumbnails, writes the
prompt, chooses and orders the references, and picks parameters. The panel's
**Direct this shot** button fills the form from the plan and shows the
rationale — nothing is queued until the artist presses Generate. See ADR 0007.

- `@name` mentions in the prompt resolve to library assets and come back as
  positional references ("Image 1"), which is what the providers understand.
- The model returns a provider-agnostic draft; code maps it onto a real
  provider from declared capabilities, so a plan can never name a model id that
  does not exist.
- Anything clamped or dropped to fit the provider is reported to the artist
  rather than silently applied.
- Optional: with no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` the service reports `director: false`
  and the panel does not offer the button.
- Try it without the panel: `npx tsx scripts/direct.ts "describe the shot"`.

## Next engineering actions

1. Run the full demo in After Effects: capture a hero frame, generate with
   Seedance 2.5, insert the clip at the playhead. Every piece is verified
   individually; the sequence as a performance is not.
2. Implement a `PublicUrlPublisher` (presigned S3/R2/GCS) to enable the
   `asset://` reference route, then switch `ARK_REFERENCE_POLICY` to `asset`.
3. Extract a real first frame for video posters, or accept the borrowed one
   and say so in the UI.
4. Confirm Seedance text-to-video parameters, and whether `video_url` /
   `audio_url` content parts are usable.
5. Milestone 5 continued: the direction agent plans but does not act. Tool use
   and an execution loop stay gated behind the rule in ADR 0007 — the agent
   proposes, the user approves anything destructive.
